/**
 * Accumulates per-verse evidence from [VersionScorer] into a running answer to "which translation is
 * being read aloud".
 *
 * A single verse is rarely enough — plenty of verses are word-identical across translations — so
 * evidence is summed across the passage with an exponential decay, and no answer is published until
 * a leader clears both an absolute evidence floor and a margin over the runner-up.
 *
 * **Off the detection thread.** [observe] only hands its arguments to [scoringExecutor] and returns;
 * all corpus reads and scoring happen there. Version detection is a nice-to-have and reading a verse
 * costs a seek into every indexed bible, so getting a verse on screen must never wait on it. The
 * queue is bounded and drops when full for the same reason — a backlog could only ever produce a
 * stale answer late.
 *
 * **Sticky.** Once an answer is published it stands until a *different* version clears the higher
 * [Config.versionSwitchMinMargin] bar, or the service falls silent for [Config.versionResetGapMs].
 * A preacher reads one bible for the whole service and moves between passages freely, so a passage
 * change is no reason to forget. The per-verse decay still does the work of letting a genuinely
 * different reader take over — stickiness governs what is *displayed* between decisions, not what
 * the evidence says.
 *
 * Threading: every field except [current] is touched only on the scoring thread. [verdict] reads the
 * one volatile, so the detection thread can call it freely. Nothing here locks.
