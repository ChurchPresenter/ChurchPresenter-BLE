/**
 * Scores one spoken verse against every version that has it, producing a per-version evidence delta.
 *
 * Plain word overlap cannot do this: ~80% of any verse is identical across translations, so the
 * shared bulk drowns the handful of words that actually distinguish them. Instead each token is
 * weighted by how RARE it is among the renderings of this one verse — the words every version shares
 * fall out to exactly zero, and what remains is the wording that identifies a version.
 *
 * Matthew 18:13 is the worked example: against KJV, NASB's distinctive set is
 * {turns, out, finds, truly, rejoices, over, more, have, gone} and KJV's is
 * {and, find, verily, unto, rejoiceth, sheep, went}. Hearing "if it turns out that he finds it"
 * lands squarely in the first set.
 *
 * Pure and stateless — [VersionDetector] holds the accumulation.
