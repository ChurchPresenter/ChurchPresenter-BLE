/**
 * Covers the re-emission churn control (2026-06-25 study §3): a held passage whose reverse-lookup
 * confidence oscillates as the window slides must NOT re-present the same verse over and over
 * (Иакова 2:19 fired 11× in the studied service). Emissions are bounded by [Config.reEmitMinDelta]
 * + [Config.reEmitCooldownMs], while a genuinely re-read passage (after the dedup TTL goes quiet)
 * still re-fires.
